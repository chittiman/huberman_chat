# Session Summary: 2025-07-27

This document summarizes the key activities and changes made during the session on July 27, 2025.

### 1. Codebase Analysis and Documentation
-   **Initial Analysis**: Performed a full analysis of the existing codebase to understand the project's structure, data pipeline, and key dependencies.
-   **Documentation**:
    -   Created `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md` to document the detailed findings of the analysis.
    -   Significantly expanded the project's `README.md` to make it more informative and useful for developers.

### 2. Data Integrity and Validation
-   **Error Identification**: Analyzed the output of the `chapter_timestamp_validators.py` script, including `validation_logs.txt` and `mistakes.txt`.
-   **Issue Triage**: Identified two primary issues: a large number of missing chapter files and a specific data error in one file (`8MfZPGpj4Sg.NA.en.srt`) where a timestamp exceeded the video's duration.
-   **Resolution**: Guided the process to resolve the specific data error and provided instructions on how to regenerate the missing chapter files.

### 3. Data Model Enhancement
-   **Objective**: To create a more robust, relational link between generated questions and the source chapter content.
-   **Changes**:
    -   Modified the `RAGQuestion` Pydantic model to include a `question_id: int` field.
    -   Updated the `ground_truth_reference` field in `RAGQuestion` to be a `List[int]`, referencing the `chapter_id`.
    -   Adjusted the question generation prompts to align with this new, more structured data model.

### 4. Logging System Refactor
-   **Objective**: To replace the inconsistent `print()` statements with a centralized, more professional logging system.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Created a new `logging_config.py` module for a standardized setup.
    -   Refactored `yt_chapters_extraction.py`, `question_generation.py`, and `chapter_timestamp_validators.py` to use the new logging system.
    -   Each script now produces structured logs to both the console and a dedicated log file.

### 5. Process Improvement
-   **Changelog**: Initiated a `changes.md` file to maintain a clear and persistent log of all significant codebase modifications.
-   **Personalization**: Saved key user preferences to memory using the `/memory` command to ensure future interactions are more efficient and tailored to the user's workflow (e.g., using `uv run`, maintaining a changelog).
