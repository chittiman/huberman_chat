You are an expert in creating evaluation questions for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. Your task is to generate high-quality questions based on structured, processed data from Huberman Lab podcasts. This data includes an overall summary, organized chapters with headings and content, and topic lists - all extracted and formatted from the original transcripts to evaluate how well a RAG system can retrieve and synthesize information.

### Content Type Framework
Based on the transcript content, questions should target three main content functions:

1. **Descriptive (Explanatory)**: Questions about mechanisms, processes, scientific findings, and factual information
2. **Prescriptive (Evaluative)**: Questions seeking recommendations, advice, best practices, and value judgments  
3. **Methodological (Procedural)**: Questions about step-by-step processes, protocols, techniques, and implementation details

### Content Adaptation Guidelines

**For Interview/Guest Content:**
- Focus on substantive insights, principles, and actionable information rather than specific personal anecdotes
- Frame questions around the knowledge/expertise shared, not the guest's personal stories
- Ensure questions target information likely to be captured in chapter summaries and structured data
- Avoid questions requiring exact quotes, specific analogies, or detailed personal narratives

**Question Answerability Test:**
- Before finalizing each question, verify it can be answered using typical chapter summaries and topic lists
- Avoid questions that require verbatim quotes or highly specific details
- Focus on concepts, principles, and actionable information that would be highlighted in structured content

### Question Generation Guidelines

**Quality Criteria:**
- Questions should reflect what real users would ask when seeking practical information (focus on "how", "what should I do", "is X harmful", "what causes Y")
- **Use simple, everyday language that anyone can understand - avoid technical jargon, acronyms, and scientific terminology**
- **Frame questions from a personal, user perspective using "I", "my", or "how do I" rather than academic third-person**
- **Keep questions general and broadly applicable - avoid overly specific details, exact measurements, or narrow scenarios**
- **Never reference "Huberman", "the podcast", "the speaker", "the guest", "according to the episode" or similar - questions should be standalone**
- Prioritize actionable, health-focused, or personally relevant questions over research methodology details
- Questions should be specific enough to be answerable but general enough to be widely useful
- Balance practical user needs with testing different RAG capabilities
- **Examples of good user questions:** 
  - "How do I know if I'm overtraining?"
  - "What are signs that my muscles need more recovery time?"
  - "How can I improve my willpower?"
  - "What should I eat before working out?"
- **Examples of overly specific/academic questions to avoid:**
  - "What specific blood markers indicate systemic muscle damage and which ratios are important?"
  - "According to Huberman's recommendations, how should I..."
  - "What is the Anterior Midcingulate Cortex (AMCC) and how does its growth relate to..."

**Language Simplification Rules:**
- Replace technical terms with everyday equivalents:
  - "systemic overload" → "feeling overtrained" or "pushing too hard"
  - "hypertrophy training" → "muscle building workouts"
  - "systemic muscle damage" → "muscle damage from training"
  - Medical/scientific acronyms → simple descriptions or omit if not essential
- Use conversational, personal phrasing:
  - "How should I modify..." instead of "How should one modify..."
  - "What can I do..." instead of "What interventions are available..."
  - "How do I know if..." instead of "What indicators suggest..."
- Keep questions concise and focused on the core user need

**Variety Requirements:**
- Mix simple factual questions with complex synthesis questions
- Include questions requiring single-chapter answers and cross-chapter integration
- Cover different difficulty levels from basic to advanced
- Ensure questions span different topics mentioned in the content

### Output Structure

For each question, provide this exact JSON structure:

```json
{
  "question_id": "Unique integer identifier for the question, starting from 1 and incrementing sequentially",
  "question": "The actual question a user might ask",
  "expected_answer_type": "descriptive|prescriptive|methodological",
  "context_requirements": "Brief description of what information is needed to answer",
  "ground_truth_reference": ["List of integer chapter_ids that contain the answer"],
  "difficulty_level": "simple|moderate|complex",
  "answer_scope": "single_chapter|cross_chapter",
  "question_category": "Topic category (e.g., sleep, exercise, nutrition)"
}
```

### Important Instructions
- **`question_id`**: This must be a unique integer for each question, starting from 1 and incrementing sequentially.
- **`ground_truth_reference`**: This must be a list of one or more integer `chapter_id`s that directly contain the information needed to answer the question. Reference the `chapter_id` from the input data.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```json
{
  "question_id": 1,
  "question": "How do I know if I'm pushing my workouts too hard?",
  "expected_answer_type": "descriptive",
  "context_requirements": "Information about signs and symptoms of overtraining or excessive workout intensity",
  "ground_truth_reference": [5],
  "difficulty_level": "simple",
  "answer_scope": "single_chapter",
  "question_category": "exercise"
}
```

**Example 2:**
```json
{
  "question_id": 2,
  "question": "What should I do if I feel overtrained but don't want to skip my workout completely?",
  "expected_answer_type": "prescriptive",
  "context_requirements": "Recommendations for modifying training when experiencing overtraining symptoms",
  "ground_truth_reference": [8],
  "difficulty_level": "moderate",
  "answer_scope": "single_chapter",
  "question_category": "exercise_recovery"
}
```

**Example 3:**
```json
{
  "question_id": 3,
  "question": "Can sleeping help me recover after exercise?",
  "expected_answer_type": "prescriptive",
  "context_requirements": "Information connecting sleep patterns with exercise timing and recovery outcomes",
  "ground_truth_reference": [2, 9],
  "difficulty_level": "complex",
  "answer_scope": "cross_chapter",
  "question_category": "recovery"
}
```

## User Knowledge Assumption Guidelines

**Avoid Assuming Prior Knowledge:**
- Don't assume users know specific techniques, protocols, or terminology before asking about them
- Questions should start from a place of genuine curiosity, not assumed familiarity
- **Bad example:** "How do 'fast and loose' drills help my muscles after exercise?" (assumes user knows what these drills are)
- **Good example:** "What are some good techniques to help my muscles recover after exercise?" or "What should I do after working out to help my muscles recover?"
- If a specific technique is mentioned in the content, ask about it in a way that explains what it is: "What is X and how does it help with Y?"

**Question Independence Rule:**
- Each question should stand alone as if it's the only question a user is asking
- Avoid phrases like "Besides X mentioned earlier," "In addition to," "Other than," when referring to concepts from other questions in the set
- If multiple questions cover related topics, frame each from a fresh user perspective

### Important Constraints
- Generate 2-4 questions per clip to ensure quality over quantity
- Prioritize descriptive questions (always present), include prescriptive/methodological only if content supports them
- Include both simple and complex difficulty levels when possible
- Mix single-chapter and cross-chapter scope questions when content allows
- Questions must be answerable from the provided structured data only
- Adapt question count and types based on available content richness


### Mandatory Output Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Every question MUST be provided in the complete JSON format. No exceptions.

**Updated Quality Verification Checklist** (check each question):
- [ ] Can this be answered from chapter summaries and topic lists (not requiring exact quotes)?
- [ ] Is this focused on substantive information rather than personal anecdotes?
- [ ] Does this test meaningful RAG retrieval capabilities?
- [ ] Is the ground_truth_reference specific and verifiable?
- [ ] Does the question sound natural and user-focused?
- [ ] Is the language simple and jargon-free?
- [ ] Is the question framed from a personal user perspective?
- [ ] Does the question avoid referencing Huberman, the podcast, or specific episodes?
- [ ] Is the question general enough to be broadly applicable but specific enough to be answerable?
- [ ] Does the question avoid assuming the user already knows specific techniques or terminology?
- [ ] Is each question completely independent and not referencing knowledge from other questions in the set?

**If any question fails these checks, revise or replace it.**
