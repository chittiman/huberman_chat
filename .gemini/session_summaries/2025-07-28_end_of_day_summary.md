# Session Summary: 2025-07-28 (End of Day)

## High-Level Summary
Today's session was highly productive. We established a clear and sophisticated strategy for our hybrid search retrieval system and began its implementation with a robust, test-driven approach. We pivoted our plan to leverage Qdrant's powerful native hybrid search capabilities, which will simplify our architecture and improve performance.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Strategy Definition:**
  - Decided on a hybrid search model combining keyword (sparse) and semantic (dense) vector search.
  - Selected **Qdrant** as our vector database, running locally via Docker.
  - Formulated a new plan to use Qdrant's server-side hybrid search and reranking features.
- **Project Organization:**
  - Created a `.gemini/planning` directory to store our strategy documents.
  - Saved our new hybrid search plan and key code examples from the Qdrant documentation for future reference.
- **Test-Driven Implementation:**
  - Established a testing framework by creating a `tests/` directory and adding `pytest` and `pytest-mock`.
  - Began implementing the `create_qdrant_index.py` script.
  - Successfully implemented and unit-tested the first two functions: `prepare_chapter_document` and `load_chapter_data`.
  - Debugged and resolved both a `ModuleNotFoundError` and a Pydantic `ValidationError` during the testing process.

## Next Steps
The immediate next step is to fix the failing test for the `load_chapter_data` function. The test's sample data needs to be updated in `tests/test_create_qdrant_index.py` to include the `timestamp` field, aligning it with the `Chapter` Pydantic model. Once that test passes, we will continue implementing the remaining functions in `create_qdrant_index.py` following our test-driven methodology.
