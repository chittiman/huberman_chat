# Session Summary: 2025-07-28

## High-Level Summary
The session focused on improving project organization and defining a clear strategy for the RAG system's retrieval component. We began by moving all Gemini-related context files into a dedicated `.gemini` directory, cleaning up the project root. After committing these changes, we shifted focus to the application's core logic. We analyzed the schema of the podcast chapter data and formulated a detailed plan to build a vector search-based retrieval system using ChromaDB and sentence-transformers.

## Key Accomplishments
- **Project Organization:**
  - Created a `.gemini` directory to house all AI-related context files.
  - Moved `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `changes.md`, and the `session_summaries/` directory into `.gemini/`.
  - Renamed `changes.md` to `CHANGES.md` for naming consistency.
  - Staged and committed these organizational changes to the Git repository.
- **RAG Strategy:**
  - Analyzed the provided JSON schema for individual podcast chapters.
  - Defined a retrieval strategy based on vector search to enable semantic understanding of user queries.
  - Outlined a two-phase plan:
    1.  **Indexing (Offline):** A script to load chapter data, create contextual embeddings (from headings, topics, and content), and store them in a local ChromaDB vector store with associated metadata.
    2.  **Retrieval (Online):** A function to take a user query, embed it, and search the vector store to find the most relevant chapter chunks.

## Next Steps
The immediate next step is to begin implementing the retrieval system:
1.  **Write the Indexing Script:** Create a new Python script to read all JSON files from `data/chapters/`.
2.  **Generate Embeddings:** Use the `sentence-transformers` library (e.g., with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model) to convert the prepared chapter text into vectors.
3.  **Build Vector Store:** Integrate ChromaDB to store the generated embeddings and their corresponding metadata (`video_id`, `chapter_id`, `content`, etc.).
4.  **Develop Retrieval Function:** Create a function that accepts a string query, embeds it, and returns the top N most similar documents from the ChromaDB index.
