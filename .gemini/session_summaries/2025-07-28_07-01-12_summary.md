# Session Summary: 2025-07-28 (07:01:12)

This document summarizes the key activities and changes made during this session.

### 1. Session Onboarding
-   Initiated a new session and successfully used the `GEMINI.md` file to quickly get up to speed on the project's status.
-   Reviewed `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`, `changes.md`, and the previous session summary to gain full context without re-analyzing the codebase.

### 2. Question Generation and Error Resolution
-   **Objective**: Generate a larger batch of evaluation questions using `question_generation.py`.
-   **Error Encountered**: The script failed with a `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error from the Google Gemini API.
-   **Diagnosis**: Analyzed the `question_generation_run.log` file and determined the error was caused by the Pydantic schema (`RAGQuestion` and `RAGQuestionSet`) being too complex and restrictive for the API.
-   **Resolution**:
    -   Modified `pydantic_models.py` to simplify the schema by removing granular validation constraints (e.g., `min_length`, `max_length`, `min_items`).
    -   The user committed this change.
    -   The user reverted a minor, temporary change in `question_generation.py`.

### 3. Documentation and Housekeeping
-   **Changelog**: Updated `changes.md` to log the schema simplification fix.
-   **Git Status**: Confirmed the final state of the repository, noting that only `changes.md` remained as a modified file.
