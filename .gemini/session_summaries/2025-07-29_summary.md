# Session Summary: 2025-07-29

## High-Level Summary

This session focused on correcting and aligning the project's Pydantic data models with the actual data structure found in the JSON files. This was a critical fix to resolve data validation and testing errors.

## Key Accomplishments

-   **Corrected Pydantic Data Models:**
    -   Updated the `VideoAnalysis` model to include the required `video_id` field.
    -   Updated the `Chapter` model to include the required `chapter_id` field.
-   **Fixed Test Suite:** The model corrections resolved `ValidationError` and `AttributeError` issues, allowing the test suite to pass.
-   **Updated Changelog:** Documented the model changes in `.gemini/CHANGES.md`.
-   **Committed Changes:** The beneficial changes were committed to the repository.

## User Decision

The user decided to discard the in-progress work on the Qdrant indexing script (`create_qdrant_index.py` and its test file) to reassess the approach.
